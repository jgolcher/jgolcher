 I recently concluded a 1-year Visiting Assistant Professor at [Lees-McRae College](https://www.lmc.edu). Over the summer, I am joining [Dr. Katie Wagner's Lab](https://cewagnerlab.com) at University of Wyoming to work on Lake Tanganyika research projects. In 2021, I graduated from University of Wyoming's [Program in Ecology](http://www.uwyo.edu/pie/) as part of Dr. Wagner's Lab. For my PhD, I identified mechanisms leading to the accumulation of cichlid fish diversity in shallow environments in the littoral of Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, combining population genomic technologies, biodiversity surveys, behavioral assays, and natural history observations. Such an integrative approach provided a unique glimpse into both the origination and persistence processes underlying endemic diversity accumulation.  
  I love learning languages, contributing to [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/users/318056) and anything outdoors/underwater.
