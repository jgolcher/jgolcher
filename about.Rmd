  I graduated this summer from University of Wyoming's [Program in Ecology](http://www.uwyo.edu/pie/) as part of  [Dr. Katie Wagner's Lab](https://cewagnerlab.com) and will be starting a job as Visiting Assistant Professor at [Lees-McRae College](http://https://www.lmc.edu/index.htm). For my PhD, I identified mechanisms leading to the accumulation of cichlid fish diversity in shallow environments in the littoral of Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, combining population genomic technologies, biodiversity surveys, behavioral assays, and natural history observations. Such an integrative approach provided a unique glimpse into both the origination and persistence processes underlying endemic diversity accumulation. 
  
  I am broadly interested in the origins and maintenance of biodiversity. Within this topic, I am fascinated by the role behavior plays in the development of early reproductive barriers between populations, emergence of complex traits and the accumulation of phenotypic diversity in the wild. I am also passionate about scientific illustration, data visualization and teaching programming for both biologists and practitioners. Both my outreach and research across different continents has aimed at fostering the well-being of both humans and nature. As part of my graduate studies, I have acted as lab/workshop instructor, guest lecturer and/or teaching assistant for various courses, including General Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Ecology and Marine Biology.
    
  I love learning languages, contributing to [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) and SCUBA.
