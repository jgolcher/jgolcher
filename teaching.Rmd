### Teaching philosophy
I strive to become an approachable, knowledgeable, and engaged teacher. Throughout my path in higher education, I have become increasingly aware of the importance of clear and transparent guidelines, integrating content in various forms, incorporate students' interests, and fostering a growth mindset. I deeply believe that engaging, well-organized, and clear roadmap for student success is one of the most effective ways to foster inclusion. My teaching aims to provide students with the opportunity to gain confidence over acquired knowledge as well as effectively identify gaps in learning. As part of my course design, I believe in presenting clear goals that closely align with learning outcomes, while providing fair assessment and constructive feedback to both evaluate learning and assess student expectations. A teacher that most inspired introduced complex content using a familiar and well-organized strategy which helped in making these more accessible. For this reason, I thrive to develop content that instill curiosity and drive within a goal-oriented framework. The process of learning is inherently multifaceted for this reason, I believe that integrating content and assessment tools in various forms can be beneficial for student learning. My experience in assisting different classes, workshops and conducting research in the topics I teach has provided me with the opportunities to present both lecture and non-lecture content in multiple ways to both nurture curiosity and learning. Integrating the interests of students is a powerful way to cultivate learning drive and self-confidence. Hands-on experience in which students take concepts learned in class and apply it to solve a puzzle or societal problem they are interested in is an ideal way to transfer knowledge and build important skills. One way I have implemented this is through an activity on biological diversity for the General Ecology course at University of Wyoming that I recently developed. In this activity students formulate a hypothesis and practice hands-on application of biodiversity metrics on their taxonomic group and location of choice using an online database (i.e. iNaturalist). In addition to incorporating customized content, I believe in integrating relevant and diverse examples into teaching, so that students can witness more of the diverse and intercultural community currently involved in the process of discovery, science and technology. One aspect of my teaching philosophy is to continuously develop skills as well as stay on top of current pedagogical practices and research. I deeply value the opportunity to be constantly growing professionally, discussing scientific ideas, and celebrating diversity through my teaching. Just as previous researchers encouraged me to pursue science, I pursue opportunities to inspire and help others to do so.

### Recent TA & other experiences

### Outreach
Along with my research interests, I strive to be an engaging science communicator activities involving both adult and children audiences. Please contact me if you are interested in a guest lecture or outreach activity on biodiversity, freshwater fish conservation or to chat about research. I love discussing scientific ideas and sharing experiences while doing aquatic fieldwork!
Every so often I make short movies that I share through a youtube channel, if interested check this one I made of [Lake Tanganyika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekSZXCzmmfc).
