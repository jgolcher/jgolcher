###Teaching philosophy

I strive to become an approachable, knowledgeable, and engaged teacher. Throughout my path in higher education, I have become increasingly aware of the importance of 1) clear and transparent guidelines, 2) integrating content in various forms, 3) incorporate students interests, and 4) fostering a growth mindset.
I deeply believe that engaging, well-organized, and clear roadmap for student success is one of the most effective ways to foster inclusion. My teaching aims to provide students with the opportunity to gain confidence over acquired knowledge as well as effectively identify gaps in learning. As part of my course design, I believe in presenting clear goals that closely align with learning outcomes, while providing fair assessment and constructive feedback to both evaluate learning and assess student expectations. A teacher that most inspired introduced complex content using a familiar and well-organized strategy which helped in making these more accessible. For this reason, I thrive to develop content that instill curiosity and drive within a goal-oriented framework.
The process of learning is inherently multifaceted since it involves neural processes, ranging from simple sensory stimulation as in hearing, to more complex cognitive mechanisms as in memory and problem-solving. For this reason, I believe that integrating content and assessment tools in various forms can be beneficial for student learning. Organized lectures that serve as a reference can be then complemented with various non-lecture material, such as active-learning and team-based activities or think-tank classrooms that more effectively consolidate knowledge acquisition in more challenging topics. My rich experience in assisting different classes, workshops and conducting research in the topics I teach has provided me with the opportunities to present both lecture and non-lecture content in multiple ways to both nurture curiosity and learning.
Integrating the interests of students is a powerful way to cultivate learning drive and self-confidence. Hands-on experience in which students take concepts learned in class and apply it to solve a puzzle or societal problem they are interested in is an ideal way to transfer knowledge and build important skills. One way I have implemented this is through an activity on biological diversity for the General Ecology course at University of Wyoming that I recently developed. In this activity students develop a hypothesis and practice hands-on application of biodiversity metrics on their taxonomic group and location of choice using an online database (i.e. iNaturalist). In addition to incorporating customized content, I believe in integrating relevant and diverse examples into teaching, so that students can witness more of the diverse and intercultural community currently involved in the process of discovery, science and technology.
One aspect of my teaching philosophy is to continuously develop teaching skills as well as stay on top of current best pedagogical practices and research. For instance, this summer 2021, I joined the Summer Institute and Yearlong Training offered online for a selected group of applicants at the University of Wyoming. During this workshop I have found a supportive community and obtained feedback on how to improve my teaching practices. I deeply value the opportunity to be constantly growing professionally, discussing scientific ideas, and celebrating diversity through my teaching.
Just as previous researchers encouraged me to pursue science, I pursue opportunities to inspire others.
